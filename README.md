# ASYMMETRICAL-MULTILEVEL-INVERTER-FOR-DYNAMIC-LOADS
Designed and implemented a multi-level inverter, which provided 7 different voltage levels as output.An asymmetrical multilevel inverter (AMLI) is a power conversion system designed to produce multiple voltage levels with DC sources. It enhances power quality, reduces harmonic distortion, and improves efficiency compared to traditional inverters.
